👋 Hi, I’m @zainabimran94

👀 I’m interested in building interactive web apps, learning AI and exploring new tech!

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development with Nuxt.js, Next.js, ASP.NET, Postgresql and AI integrations.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun web projects, AI-powered apps, and anything that pushes my learning!

📫 How to reach me: zainab.abid1994@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I love building fun and quirky projects to keep my learning process exciting! 
I built a weather app where the train only moves in good weather 🌞, 
and a cafe app with a milkshake game 🥤 that challenged me to learn new things!
